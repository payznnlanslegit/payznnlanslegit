Corporate lending, also known as business lending, refers to the loans, lines of credit and other financial products that are given to companies instead of individuals. The funds from a business loan can be used for working capital; to purchase inventory and supplies; to buy equipment, business vehicles and commercial property among other things.

Banks, online lenders and financial services companies are some of the best options available to borrowers seeking business-related funding.
