Invoice factoring can be a good choice for business-to-business companies with cash tied up in unpaid invoices. Factoring is another type of asset-based financing that can be accessible to borrowers who may not qualify for traditional loan options.

With invoice factoring, you sell your outstanding invoices to a factoring company at a discount. The company pays you a percentage of the invoice upfront and then assumes responsibility for collecting payment from your customers.

Similar to hard money loans, lenders often focus on the value of your invoices and your customerâ€™s payment history when evaluating your application. For this reason, invoice factoring can also be a good option for startup companies and borrowers with bad credit.
